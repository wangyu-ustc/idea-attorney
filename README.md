# idea-attorney

With a given research idea, this project aims to refine the idea while building two agents, one determined to argue that the idea is worthless and the other is defending the idea according to your initial points of why they are good and also propose to refine your points and propose new points. In the end, when the judger cannot find any loopholes of your idea, the obtained idea should be a good one. During the conversation, they also should be able to construct some consensus and good points about why this idea is good. It is also possible that the defender may fail to come up with complete logic to protect the idea, then the idea is probably not good enough to proceed. 

## Next Steps:

1. Try to build an interface. 
2. Try to allow the user to interfere and add some points to aid the defender/critic.
